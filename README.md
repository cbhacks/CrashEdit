## Features ##
Currently, this program is not capable of modifying any game files. The current feature set includes:

* Extracting sound effects in wave format
* Extracting speech in wave format
* Extracting music sequences in SEQ or MIDI format
* Extracting most data in a binary format

You will need Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or an alternative such as Mono __(untested)__. In the case of Mono, you will need the following referenced assemblies:
